# Quiz Game

## This project was made with the intent to test the users knowledge of javascript. Each question challenges the user by subtracting time if you choose the wrong answer. The better the time, the higher the score! At the end of the quiz, the user has a chance to enter their initials and save their score on the "highscores" page.

## By doing this project, I learned how to use local storage to store data on a page. I also perfected how to use "if/else" statements and the appropriate times to do so.
